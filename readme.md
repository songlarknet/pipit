# Pipit

Pipit is (will be) a formalisation of a small Lustre-style reactive language in [F*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/).
Reactive languages are generally useful for writing realtime control systems, but Pipit itself is not at a useful stage yet.
I hope to be able to re-use F-star's proof automation (via SMT) for model-checking programs.
